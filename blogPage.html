            <p class="text-blog">After months of preparation and hard work, we were eager to take our first product, smartphone based BP machine, to test in the real world outside the clinic and see how it performs. We have been seeking an opportunity not just to test the product but also spend some time with users to understand their needs and requirements. Fortunately, we got in contact with eminent Padamshree Dr. B Ramana Rao and got a chance to discuss with him about our startup and our vision. He asked us to visit his village clinic situated at T.Begur road on Sunday to meet people and understand them. We took this great opportunity and planned our visit to his clinic. <br><br>
On Sunday, we drove to his clinic and when we reached there we saw a huge line of people standing outside the clinic and waiting for Dr. Rao. These people came from everywhere. Most of these people are regular visitor and come alone because they don’t have anybody to take care of them. It was heartbreaking to see people in their 80’s walked alone miles to visit the clinic. <br><br>
After reaching there, our team decided to split into two groups, one to test our machine and another to talk to people. We took blood pressure for more than 70 people and it performed really well although it had some issues. Meanwhile other group was talking to people and trying to understand their problems and issues related to heath and care. It was sad to know, most of the people are living alone and no one is there to take care of them. Either their children moved out from home or they don’t have anybody.  Fortunately, these people are not suffering from any major health issues but they lack basic health care which Dr. Rao and his family is providing since 1973 every Sunday.
